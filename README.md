# How to use 
## To add a new animal,  you just have to type the name of the animal and click "Add". When you add the name of the animal, it'll randomly setup a type for the animal like "Cow, Sheep or Duck"
## The Delete button will appear when you hover over a Card.
### Unfortunatly I couldn't find a available Pig sound, so I change to a Duck Sound.
